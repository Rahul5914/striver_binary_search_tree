Now let’s go through Leetcode 236 — Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
in full Nutanix / FAANG interview style, where the interviewer expects deep reasoning, debugging ability, and difference from BST version.

🧩 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
🔹 Problem Statement
Given a binary tree (not necessarily a BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes p and q.

The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants.
A node can be a descendant of itself.

Example
markdown
Copy code
         3
        / \
       5   1
      / \ / \
     6  2 0  8
       / \
      7  4
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: LCA(5,1) = 3

🔹 Interview Dialogue (Realistic FAANG/Nutanix Style)
👨‍💼 Interviewer:
You solved the BST LCA efficiently using properties. Now, what if I remove the BST property — just a normal binary tree?

👨‍💻 You:
Then we can’t use value comparisons like < or >.
We must traverse the entire tree and find where both nodes p and q exist.

👨‍💼 Interviewer:
Exactly. So how would you detect that a node is their lowest common ancestor?

👨‍💻 You:
For each node, we can recursively check:

If p and q are in different subtrees, then that node is the LCA.

If both are in left or right, continue exploring that side.

If current node is p or q, and the other node lies in its subtree → this node is also the LCA.

🔹 Step-by-Step Reasoning
Let’s define a recursive function LCA(root, p, q):

If root is nullptr → return nullptr

If root equals p or q → return root

Recur for left and right subtree:

ini
Copy code
left = LCA(root->left, p, q)
right = LCA(root->right, p, q)
If both left and right are non-null, then current root is LCA (split point).

Else, return the non-null side.

🔹 Recurrence Relation
sql
Copy code
LCA(root, p, q) = 
    root                     if root == p or root == q
    LCA(root->left, p, q)    if both p,q are in left
    LCA(root->right, p, q)   if both p,q are in right
    root                     if one in left and one in right
🔹 Approach 1: Recursive DFS Solution
🔧 Intuition:
We explore the tree like a post-order traversal (L, R, Root) —
we first find results in left and right, then decide for the current node.

✅ Code (C++):
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // Base case: if root is null or one of the targets found
        if (!root || root == p || root == q)
            return root;

        // Search in left and right subtrees
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

        // If both sides return non-null → current node is LCA
        if (left && right)
            return root;

        // Otherwise, return the non-null child
        return left ? left : right;
    }
};
🧮 Complexity
Time: O(N) — we visit every node once

Space: O(H) — recursion stack (H = tree height)

🔹 Approach 2: Parent Mapping + BFS (Iterative)
Interviewer follow-up:
What if I ask you to find LCA iteratively, without recursion?

Your Thought:
We can use a parent map for every node, then trace the ancestors.

Steps:
Use DFS/BFS to store each node’s parent.

Store all ancestors of p in a set.

Move upward from q to the root — the first ancestor found in the set is the LCA.

Code:
cpp
Copy code
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*> parent;
        queue<TreeNode*> qn;
        qn.push(root);
        parent[root] = nullptr;

        // Step 1: Build parent map using BFS
        while (!parent.count(p) || !parent.count(q)) {
            TreeNode* node = qn.front();
            qn.pop();

            if (node->left) {
                parent[node->left] = node;
                qn.push(node->left);
            }
            if (node->right) {
                parent[node->right] = node;
                qn.push(node->right);
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Store ancestors of p
        unordered_set<TreeNode*> ancestors;
        while (p) {
            ancestors.insert(p);
            p = parent[p];
        }

        // Step 3: Move upward from q until we hit an ancestor of p
        while (!ancestors.count(q))
            q = parent[q];

        return q;
    }
};
⏱️ Time Complexity: O(N)
💾 Space Complexity: O(N)

Find LCA(5,1):

Node	Left Result	Right Result	Return
6	null	null	null
2	7→null, 4→null	→ null	
5	found p	null	p (5)
1	found q	null	q (1)
3	left=p, right=q	✅ return 3	

✔️ LCA = 3

🔹 Common Pitfalls
❌ Returning too early when one subtree returns null
✅ Remember post-order structure (process children first)
❌ Confusing this logic with BST property-based approach

🔹 Follow-up Questions (asked in FAANG & Nutanix)
What if nodes p or q do not exist in tree?
→ Add existence check first.

What if tree is very deep (skewed)?
→ Recursion can cause stack overflow → use parent map iterative approach.

How to find distance between p and q using LCA?
→ dist(p, q) = depth(p) + depth(q) - 2 * depth(LCA)

🔹 Pattern Recognition
Concept	Trick
Binary Tree	Use post-order traversal
BST	Use value comparison to move left/right
Split Point	When one node found in each subtree
Template	Reusable for any “find common node” problems (like path intersection)

🔹 Interview Comparison Summary
Feature	BST LCA (Leetcode 235)	Binary Tree LCA (Leetcode 236)
Uses value property	✅ Yes	❌ No
Traversal Type	Conditional (guided)	Full tree traversal
Time Complexity	O(h)	O(n)
Space Complexity	O(1) / O(h)	O(h)
Pattern	Move left/right	Post-order recursion

Would you like me to now give the debugging-style dry run (like Nutanix round 2 whiteboard simulation) — where interviewer gives tricky cases like “one node is ancestor of the other”?
That’s a favorite follow-up in FAANG too.

Awesome 💪
Let’s now go through the debugging-style dry run of LCA in a Binary Tree (Leetcode 236) exactly how it happens in a Nutanix / FAANG final-round whiteboard session.

🎯 Debugging Simulation — Nutanix / FAANG Interview
Scenario:
You’ve written your recursive code for LCA (from above).
Now the interviewer tests your edge-case reasoning and dry-run debugging skills.

🧩 Code Reminder (Recursive LCA)
cpp
Copy code
TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
    if (!root || root == p || root == q)
        return root;

    TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
    TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

    if (left && right)
        return root;

    return left ? left : right;
}
🧠 Interviewer Setup
👨‍💼 Interviewer:
Let’s dry run this code on a few edge cases.

🧩 Case 1 — One Node Is Ancestor of the Other
Tree:

markdown
Copy code
        3
       / \
      5   1
     / \
    6   2
       / \
      7  4
We’re finding LCA(5,4).

▶️ Dry Run
Call	root	Return
LCA(3,5,4)	root=3	
→ left = LCA(5,5,4)	root=5==p ✅ return 5	
→ right = LCA(1,5,4)	no match → null	
Now left=5, right=null → return left (5)		

✅ Answer = 5

👨‍💼 Interviewer:
Why did we return 5 even though 4 is deeper?

👨‍💻 You:
Because the algorithm returns the node if it matches p or q — that node can be an ancestor.
When we find p and later discover q is in its subtree, that p becomes the LCA.

💡 Key Insight:

If one node is ancestor of the other → ancestor itself is the LCA.

🧩 Case 2 — Nodes on Different Sides
Find LCA(5,1) (Classic case).

markdown
Copy code
        3
       / \
      5   1
Call	root	left	right	Return
3	→ LCA(5,1)	left=p, right=q	return root=3	

✅ Answer = 3

🧩 Case 3 — Both in Left Subtree
Find LCA(6,4)

markdown
Copy code
        3
       / \
      5   1
     / \
    6   2
       / \
      7  4
Step-by-Step:

root=3

left = LCA(5,6,4)

right = null

In subtree rooted at 5:

left = LCA(6,6,4) → returns 6

right = LCA(2,6,4)

left = LCA(7,6,4) → null

right = LCA(4,6,4) → returns 4
→ return 2 (split point)

Now left=6, right=2 → return 5

root=3 → left=5, right=null → return 5

✅ Answer = 5

🧩 Case 4 — Only One Node Exists in Tree
Find LCA(5,10) (10 is not in tree)

markdown
Copy code
        3
       / \
      5   1
Dry Run:

Step	root	Result
LCA(3,5,10)	left = LCA(5,5,10) = 5	right = LCA(1,5,10) = null
Return left = 5		

✅ Output = 5
⚠️ But 10 doesn’t exist, so answer is invalid logically.

👨‍💼 Interviewer:
How would you fix this?

👨‍💻 You:
We can modify our recursion to also track existence:

Perform a DFS returning (foundNode, foundCount).

After recursion, ensure both p and q are found before returning the answer.

Example:

cpp
Copy code
bool find(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target) {
    if (!root) return false;
    if (root == target) return true;
    return find(root->left, target) || find(root->right, target);
}

TreeNode* LCA(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
    TreeNode* lca = lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q);
    if (find(root, p) && find(root, q))
        return lca;
    return nullptr;  // One node missing
}
🧩 Case 5 — Skewed Tree (Deep Recursion)
markdown
Copy code
     1
      \
       2
        \
         3
          \
           4
Find LCA(2,4)
→ Traversal is one-directional (no branching).
✅ Works fine but recursion depth = height of tree.

👨‍💼 Interviewer:
What’s the drawback?
👨‍💻 You:
Stack overflow for very deep trees (~10⁵).
So we can switch to an iterative parent map approach.

🧩 Summary Table of All Scenarios
Case	Scenario	Expected LCA	Behavior
1	One node ancestor of another	Ancestor itself	✅ correct
2	Nodes on different sides	Common root	✅ correct
3	Both in same subtree	Deepest common node	✅ correct
4	One node missing	Should handle explicitly	⚠️ need existence check
5	Deep skewed tree	Works but stack-heavy	⚠️ iterative version better

🧠 Key Debugging Insights
Tip	Why Important
Base case order matters	Must check `root == p
Return from children correctly	Use left ? left : right
Test ancestor cases	Very common interviewer trick
Add existence validation	Avoid wrong LCA for missing nodes
Consider stack depth	Optimize using parent mapping for huge trees

🔹 Pattern Recognition (Final Revision Tip)
Category	Pattern	Example Problems
Binary Tree	Post-order traversal based LCA	236. LCA of Binary Tree
BST	Guided traversal using values	235. LCA of BST
Graph/Parent Mapping	Parent + Ancestor set	1650. LCA of N-ary Tree
Ancestor Case	Node itself can be LCA	Common interview trap

🔥 Final Takeaway for Interviews (Nutanix, Google, Amazon):

When you hear “LCA,” first identify the tree type (BST vs Binary Tree).
Then use the correct traversal pattern.
Always dry-run ancestor edge cases — it’s a favorite debugging trap question.
